Student Enrollment Prediction Model
This project develops a machine learning model to predict student enrollment and identify students who may need additional support to graduate, using historical student data, academic records, and demographic information.

Objective
The goal is to create a predictive model that helps educational institutions identify which students are likely to enroll in a program and who may need intervention to ensure graduation success.

Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest
Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Modeling: Training and evaluating multiple regression and classification models.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC.
Privacy Protection: Techniques to anonymize student data for model development and compliance with privacy standards.
Dataset
The project uses historical data that includes:

Student Academic Records (e.g., CGPA, test scores)
Student Demographic Data (e.g., age, gender, university rating)
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Mozelkrypton/student-enrollment-prediction.git
Install required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

Results
The model provides predictions on student enrollment and suggests students who may need additional academic support.
